# Bookbot

## A program designed to analyze large text files

Bookbot is a program written in python which takes in a large text file, reads it and outputs the following information about it:

* Count the total amount of words
* Count the total amount of letters
* Count the individual amount each letter is repeated

## How to install and use

* Download and run the main.py file
* Make sure your text is stored in a file, this program does not support direct copy-pasted information
* Chose between typing the path to your text file manually or browsing your files*
* Enjoy your statistics!

*Note that if you chose to manually type your file's path, you may copy-paste it from your file explorer but you will need to add the file's name manually.\
ie: D:\documents\books - wrong\
    D:\documents\books\my_book.txt - correct\

## Dependencies

This program requires python 3.0 or higher to function. Additionally, it uses os and tkinter, both of which are part of Python's standard library and require no additional installation.
