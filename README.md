# Bookbot

## A program designed to analyze large text files

Bookbot is a program written in python which takes in a large text file, reads it and outputs the following information about it:

* Count the total amount of words
* Count the total amount of letters
* Count the individual amount each letter is repeated

## How to install and use

* Download and run the main.py file (note that you will need python 3.0 or higher downloaded to run this program)
* Make sure your text is stored in a file, this program does not support direct copy-pasted information
* Chose between typing the path to your text file manually or browsing your files*
* Enjoy your statistics!

*Note that if you chose to manually type your file's path, you may copy-paste it from your file explorer but you will need to add the file's name manually.
ie: user/documents/books - wrong
    user/documents/books/my_book.txt - correct
